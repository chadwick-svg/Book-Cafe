# Book-Cafe
## Overview
EcoLife Hub is a sustainable lifestyle website dedicated to promoting eco-friendly products and practical green living tips. The site features a rebranded design with a new color scheme, updated content, and responsive layouts built around fresh SM (mobile) and MD (tablet) breakpoints.

## Color System
- **Primary (#228B22 - Forest Green):** Represents trust, nature, and a commitment to sustainability.
- **Secondary (#F5F5DC - Natural Beige):** Provides a neutral, organic background that enhances readability.
- **Accent (#FF7F50 - Coral):** Adds energy and vibrancy to calls-to-action (buttons, hover effects) while maintaining WCAG AA compliance through strong contrast.

## Breakpoint Logic
- **Small (SM):** Up to 480px. Adjusts the header into a vertical layout with stacked navigation and reduced hero section padding and font sizes for mobile-friendly viewing.
- **Medium (MD):** 481px to 1023px. Adopts a two-column grid for product and tip cards while keeping text sizes and spacing balanced for tablets.
- **Large (LG):** 1024px and above. Retains the structural consistency of the card layouts; elements such as navigation and typography are scaled appropriately for desktop views.

## Creative Divergence from the Original Mockup
- **Rebranding:** The website now embodies the eco-friendly message of "EcoLife Hub" instead of a book cafe. All placeholder texts and images have been replaced with sustainable living content.
- **Layout Enhancements:** Beyond color changes, the navigation, hero section, and card layouts have been tailored to offer improved readability and visual hierarchy on small and medium devices.
- **User Experience:** The interactive contact form now thanks visitors for their interest, reinforcing the supportive community ethos of EcoLife Hub.

## Code Quality
- **Clean & Commented:** All code is well-commented with consistent naming conventions. No inline styles are used.
- **External Resources:** CSS and JavaScript are kept in separate files for improved maintainability.
