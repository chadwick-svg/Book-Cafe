# Book Café

## Overview
Book Café is a warm and inviting website for literature and coffee enthusiasts. It offers a cozy space where visitors can explore handcrafted brews, curated books, and now, community events—all with a responsive design ensuring a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Color System
- **Primary (#8B5E3C):** An earthy brown used for headings, logos, and borders—evoking warmth and authenticity.
- **Secondary (#F5F5DC):** A gentle off-white background that reinforces the relaxed ambiance and enhances readability.
- **Accent (#D2691E):** A vibrant tone applied in hover effects and calls-to-action, ensuring strong contrast and visual emphasis.

## Breakpoint Logic
- **Small Devices (SM):** Up to 480px. The header stacks vertically, navigation shifts to a column layout, and the hero section’s padding and font sizes are reduced for optimal mobile viewing.
- **Medium Devices (MD):** 481px to 1023px. Key sections such as menu, books, and events convert to a two-column grid layout to balance content density, while overall spacing and typography adjust to maintain visual hierarchy.
- **Large Devices (LG):** 1024px and above. The website retains its structural consistency with only scale adjustments for a refined desktop experience.

## Additional Content
- **Community Events Section:** A new section dedicated to highlighting weekly events (book signings, poetry nights, creative writing workshops) that foster community engagement and enrich the Book Café experience.

## Design Adjustments
- **Maintaining the Book Café Theme:** All original branding elements, content, and imagery have been kept. The site continues to evoke that cozy, local café feel.
- **Responsive Enhancements:** New SM and MD breakpoints ensure that the website is accessible and visually appealing across all devices.
- **Clean, Commented Code:** All code is maintained in external CSS and JavaScript files using consistent naming conventions for maintainability.
